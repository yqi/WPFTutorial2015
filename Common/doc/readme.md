# This project shows how to use Class Library in C# NET

## Difference between Class Library, Portable Class Libraries (PCL), and Shared Project
#### Class Library 
- compiled and the unit of reuse is the assembly.
- not portable
#### Portable Class Libraries (PCL) 
- compiled and the unit of reuse is the assembly.
- means Windows Desktop classic, Windows Store, Windows Phone, XBox, etc. Still Windows Platform
- PCL is not going to have Full Access to .NET Framework
#### Shared Project 
- the unit of reuse is the source code, and the shared code is incorporated into each assembly that references the shared project.
- There will not be separate dlls created.  
- portable
- cannot have dependencies on third-party libraries.
- have Full Access to .NET Framework
